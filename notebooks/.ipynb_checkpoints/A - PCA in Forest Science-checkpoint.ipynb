    "* <font color=darkgreen>**C - *Forstbotanischer Garten* 3D.**</font> An example similar to that in notebook B, with real meteorological data from the forest botanical garden in Eberswalde. Key points are the correlations between variables and the importance of scaling them prior to PCA.\n",
    "* <font color=darkgreen>**D - *Forstbotanischer Garten* Stations.**</font> A more complex example including 6 meteorological stations located in the forest botanical garden in Eberswalde, each giving measurements of 7 variables. It shows the use of **scree plots** and **biplots** to show feature importance and clustering."

    "Principal Component Analysis, PCA, is used to transform a set of data, i.e. a table, into another one. The information in the quantities is mixed together and given in another form. The number variables is the same, meaning that the new data table has the same dimensions than the first one. The good point is that the new table has the data ordered according to their importance in explaining (the variance of) the data in the original table.\n",
